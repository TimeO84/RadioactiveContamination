# RadioactiveContamination

Link: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Contamination

Adds radioactive contamination to your gameplay. Radiation does decay on players (not on items, DOT) , does not stop immediately after exposure stops. Radiation is not like pollution, it is only around radioactive items.

Following items are toxic:
- uranium ore (less toxic)
- producing nuclear reactor (less toxic)
- producing centrifuge (more toxic)
- uranium 235 / uranium 238 (less toxic)
- uranium fuel cell (less toxic)
- used up uranium fuel cell (very toxic)

If you want it more or less toxic, you can change the toxicity-value multipier like 0.8 for less toxic or 1.2 for more radiation.

New in 0.0.8: configurable radiation. Radioactive player inventory
